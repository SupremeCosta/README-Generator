  ## Description
  This command-line application takes user input and generates a README.md file that users can include in their own projects. The user will be prompted for their GitHub username and email, as well as information about their project, including title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, and test instructions. They will also be able to choose from a list of open source licenses for their project. This tool is great for any developer looking to quickly create a professional README for a new project.
